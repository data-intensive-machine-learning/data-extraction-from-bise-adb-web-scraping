The file named ADB Python project has all of the scrapping code in it when you run the file, a menu appears from where you can select 
1. supply
2. 2022
3. 2023
4. exit
When you select your desired option for scrapping, you have to input the start roll no, end roll no and excel file name (placed in same directory as the python file)
the program the fetches the result and saves it in the excel file. I have uploaded screenshots for clear understanding.
I have also wrote the python code to merge two excel files because we were working on smaller data sets as larger data sets were taking too much time and over loading the website resulting in server disconnection
Thank you,
